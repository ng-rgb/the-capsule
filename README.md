# the-capsule
6.11.2022 | Latam & Europe 
This repository aims to consolidate ideas and proposals within a large group of electronic & digital artists using the Ethereum blockchain to create a capsule with meaningful art+tech+science projects.
We identify as Ethereans, meaning we believe in a solar punk vision but also with a critical point of view of what is happening on the earth.
This capsule will be send to outer space as a preservation archive of the history of humanity showing environmental, political, economical and social matters in digital creations.
